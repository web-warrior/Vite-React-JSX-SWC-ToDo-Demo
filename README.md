# This ToDo List demo was built with the vite-plugin-react-swc plugin 

SWC, "Speedy Web Compiler" builds faster than Babel

To run in dev mode use:
$ npm run dev

To compile a production build use (although, this demo "as is" is not intended for production use):
$ npm run build



### This ToDo List demo was created by Jenny McClaine and as an exercise in a small set of responsive IU and interactive form functionality

This demo allows a user to add, edit, delete and mark ToDo List items as completed
The list items are not saved or stored anywhere so when page is refreshed/reloaded the task list is going to reset to 'none'.

For now, this demo is not intended to become a fully developed application.



### React + Vite Build plugin information

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Reloading) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
